# FireX

Update:

FireXV3 can destroy a computer, it's a compiled version of bomb.bat

1.0:
 
FireX is a fake antivirus, this isn't meant to be malicous, more of a POC to show another method for ruining a computer.

FireX.bat and the exe are just anoying, BOMB.bat could be malicous. It attempts to crash your computer by filling your desktop with 1000's of files. 

Why did I make this?

I was tired, tired of everything getting detected by anti viruses. And I can't make RATs yet so I am just making software to ruin an OS. 

Anyways report any bugs, this is my first test project.
