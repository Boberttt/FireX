# FireX
IMPORTANT:
 
V2 and V1 are the same (V2 is better), V3 is meant to harm your computer (I tested it, it works, message me if you need help recovering). These will be updated under the same names
 
2.0:
 
Now has some basic things that I forgot.
 
3.0:

FireXV3 can destroy a computer, it's a compiled version of bomb.bat

1.0:
 
FireX is a fake antivirus, this isn't meant to be malicous, more of a POC to show another method for ruining a computer.

FireX.bat and the exe are just anoying, BOMB.bat could be malicous. It attempts to crash your computer by filling your desktop with 1000's of files. 

Why did I make this?

I was tired, tired of everything getting detected by anti viruses. And I can't make RATs yet so I am just making software to ruin an OS. 

Anyways report any bugs, this is my first test project.
